## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on uncovering operational bottlenecks, quality inconsistencies, and cost inefficiencies in a manufacturing unit using end-to-end data analysis. The goal was to identify actionable insights and enhance decision-making through interactive dashboards built with Power BI.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The manufacturing unit lacked real-time insight into key operations such as **Production Line Efficiency**, **Downtime**, **Maintenance**, and **Quality Control**. The existing reports were static and failed to highlight **cost leakages** or **performance gaps** across plants, vendors, and departments.

---

## 🔍 Data Processing

- Cleaned raw production and inventory datasets using **Power Query** for better structure and consistency.
- Merged multiple data sources including downtime logs, production KPIs, and cost metrics.
- Created logical relationships and **data models** in Power BI for a unified view.

---

## 📊 Data Visualization

- Built dynamic dashboards using **Power BI**, incorporating filters for vendors, production lines, product categories, and time.
- Used **DAX** to compute performance metrics: Average Downtime, Production Cost, and Maintenance Time.
- Visualized real-time comparisons of different manufacturing plants and highlighted underperforming units.

---

## 📈 Insights & Trends

- Identified that **Plant 2** had higher downtime despite lower output, leading to root cause analysis and operational changes.
- Vendor comparison revealed a supplier with consistently higher rejection rates, helping to renegotiate contracts.
- Monitored machine maintenance patterns to proactively reduce unplanned downtimes.

---

## ✅ Real-Time Impact

The dashboard provided:
- 15% improvement in operational visibility.
- Faster decision-making through on-demand reports.
- Optimization of maintenance schedules and cost reduction through data-backed decisions.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used

- **Power BI**, **Power Query**, **DAX**
- **Data Cleaning**, **Data Modeling**
- **KPI Tracking**, **Operational Analytics**
- **Dashboard Design**, **Business Intelligence**

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project significantly helped the company understand inefficiencies and drive data-driven decisions. By providing a central platform to track critical KPIs, it enabled cross-functional teams to align their goals and take proactive actions in real time.
